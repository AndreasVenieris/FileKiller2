# FileKiller2
It completely removes a file from your disk without leaving any track.
The program is my upgraded version of FileKiller 1, I created to Sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/filekiller/).

Features
- High Performance deletions.
- Ability to choose the number of overwrite iterations (1 to 100).
- Ability to choose the overwrite method between Blanks / Random Data / a User Defined Ascii Character.
- Ability to remove files on directories and subdirectories.
- The user can choose file(s) or directory. The latest supposes that all files of the specific dir will be deleted.
- A Registry entry is given (a Reg file) in order to run the program from Explorer by Right Click.
- Completely removes Data as well as Filename from Disk.
- No setup is needed, you get just a single executable.
- Overcomes the 2Gb file size barrier. Files with any size can be deleted in a very short time.
- It uses threats so the user can choose more files while others beign deleted.

Requirements
- Requires .net framewrok 4.0
- Windows 7, 8.x, 10.

WARNNING: Be carefull when deleting files since after deletion the recovery is not possible!!
